            The Babar Azam-led Pakistan cricket team, despite a good start to
            the Asia Cup 2023, could not keep up the momentum and were knocked
            out of the Super 4 stage. The Pakistan team were pegged back by
            injuries of Haris Rauf and Naseem Shah too. Though they fought till
            the end, Pakistan could not go over the line as victors in a
            well-contested match against Sri Lanka, and were shown the door. The
            loss to Sri Lanka would rankle the team for a long time as it was
            one of the biggest tournament ahead of the Cricket World Cup in
            India. To make matters worse, according to a report of Pakistan
            media outlet Bol News, Pakistan captain Babar Azam and Shaheen
            Afridi were engaged in a war of words after the defeat to Sri Lanka.
            According to the report, after the loss, Babar questioned the role
            of the senior players in the Asia Cup 2023 campaign. However,
            Shaheen interrupted him and said he should not generalise and not
            criticises those who did well. Babar then replied that he is well
            aware about who is doing well and who's not. The report added that
            Babar, went to the press conference after the loss, and on his way
            to the hotel did not talk to anybody. Kusal Mendis' 91 and an
            unbeaten 49 by Charith Asalanka helped Sri Lanka edge out Pakistan
            by two wickets in a last-ball thriller of the Asia Cup to set up a
            final clash with India. Chasing a DLS revised target of 252 in the
            42-overs-a-side contest in Colombo, Sri Lanka needed eight from the
            final over and achieved the target with Asalanka's winning hit on
            the last ball. A raucous home crowd rejoiced but the result broke
            the heart of millions of fans awaiting an India-Pakistan final in
            the 50-over tournament, a prelude to the upcoming ODI World Cup.
